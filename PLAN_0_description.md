# PLAN 0 ‚Äî Project Vision & Feature Scope

## ‚ú® Project Elevator Pitch

A **stream-first, modern AI chat workspace** built with Phoenix LiveView, Ash Framework and pure Elixir.  
Users can open multiple chat ‚Äúconversations‚Äù, see their message history at a glance, and enjoy real-time, token-by-token AI responses that feel as if the assistant is typing live.

*No database, no extra dependencies* ‚Äî persistence is handled by lightweight CSV files so the whole stack stays lean and deploy-friendly.

## Core User Stories

1. **Start a New Chat**  
   ‚Ä¢ Click a ‚Äú+ New Chat‚Äù button to open a blank conversation.  
   ‚Ä¢ The sidebar instantly lists the new chat with an editable title (defaults to today‚Äôs date & time).

2. **Send Messages & See Live AI Typing**  
   ‚Ä¢ Type into a single-line input (auto-expands for long text) and press Enter.  
   ‚Ä¢ Immediately see your message appear in the transcript.  
   ‚Ä¢ Watch the AI assistant stream its reply token-by-token for an authentic ‚Äútyping‚Äù effect.

3. **Switch Between Conversations**  
   ‚Ä¢ Sidebar lists all previous chats.  
   ‚Ä¢ Clicking a chat loads its full history without page reloads.  
   ‚Ä¢ Active chat is highlighted; unread badge shows if the AI is still responding in a background chat.

4. **Persistent History**  
   ‚Ä¢ Each chat transcript is appended to a per-chat CSV file (`priv/data/chat_logs/<chat-id>.csv`).  
   ‚Ä¢ On reconnect or page refresh, the LiveView reconstructs the history from CSV so nothing is lost.

5. **Rename or Delete Chats**  
   ‚Ä¢ Hovering a chat title reveals ‚úèÔ∏è (rename) and üóëÔ∏è (delete) icons.  
   ‚Ä¢ Rename opens an inline input; delete asks for confirmation.

6. **Clear Chat**  
   ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúClear conversation‚Äù action removes all messages from view but keeps the chat shell for fresh context.  
   ‚Ä¢ Under the hood `stream_reset/3` wipes the LiveView stream; the CSV file is archived not erased.

## UI Mood-Board

‚Ä¢ **Layout**: Two-pane design: slim left sidebar (max 280 px) for conversations; right pane for active chat.  
‚Ä¢ **Styling**: Tailwind 3 utility classes + DaisyUI theme already present in assets.  
‚Ä¢ **Colour Palette**: Neutral dark mode first (slate/stone), accent with indigo & emerald for buttons and highlights.  
‚Ä¢ **Typography**: Inter or system sans-serif, 14-15 px base, 1.6 line height.

**Delight Details**
- Subtle pulsating cursor while AI is streaming.  
- Smooth auto-scroll to newest message (unless user scrolls up, then show a ‚ÄúJump to bottom‚Äù pill).  
- Chat bubbles fade-in (@keyframes) for a soft feel.

## Technical Pillars (high-level)

1. **Phoenix LiveView** ‚Äî Real-time UI, WebSocket transport, `live_stream/4` for incremental rendering.  
2. **Ash Framework** ‚Äî Domain & auth layer; potentially expose chats/messages as resources if future DB is added.  
3. **CSV Storage** ‚Äî Minimal flat-file persistence using Elixir‚Äôs `File` & `IO` modules.  
4. **Task.async + PubSub** ‚Äî Non-blocking AI calls; future-proof for multi-user broadcasting.

## Nice-to-Have (not MVP)

- **Search across chats** (client-side fuzzy filter first).  
- **Export conversation** to Markdown or JSON.  
- **Keyboard shortcuts** (Cmd+K to focus input, Cmd+Shift+N for new chat, etc.).  
- **Responsive mobile layout**: drawer instead of sidebar.

---
## Out-of-Scope for MVP

- User authentication (can layer AshAuthentication later).  
- File uploads / image generation.  
- Vector database or embeddings search.  
- Any additional Hex or NPM dependency.

### Success Criteria

‚úî Users can hold multiple parallel chats and switch seamlessly.  
‚úî AI replies stream in real time without blocking UI.  
‚úî Chat histories survive browser refresh thanks to CSV logs.  
‚úî The interface feels lightweight, responsive, and visually polished with zero additional dependencies.
