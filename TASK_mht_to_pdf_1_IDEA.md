the thing is that we need to convert mht files when they are uploaded to a pdf file so that we can progress with this as with any other uploaded pdf file.
do pdf file is our format of choice.
So that is why we need to make sure that we create a pdf file on upload.

The thing is though that we can only use the entry for chatting if we have a pdf file.
This might take some time until we have a pd file.
So this needs to be reflected on the upload page - like "converting to pdf" until that process of c onversion is finished
and until that we can not present it to the user on the chat page as source for a chat.

The processing of mht to pdf will happen on a remote server via a rest call where we push the mht file and will get the pdf backa
